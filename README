PressGang Belay contains a suite of projects to facilitate RESTful web service security using OAuth2 and OpenID. It offers OAuth2 Authorization Server and Resource Server libraries, leveraging the Apache Amber project, that support OAuth2's Authorization Code and Implicit flows. OpenID is used for end-user authentication, although non-browser apps can also be catered for with non-expiring access tokens. PressGang Belay includes a GWT library to support a GWT client-side in the Implict flow. It also offers an OpenID provider implementation.  

The OpenId directory contains a sample OpenID server implementation.
The OAuth2 directory contains an OAuth2 authorization server library with sample webapp implementation and an OAuth2 resource server library with an example REST app that uses this library. It also contains a GWT OAuth2 client library and corresponding sample app.

Development work still in progress.

Why the name? According to one online pirate dictionary (http://www.thepiratesrealm.com/pirate%20talk.html), belay means "either to tie something down tight and secure...or to stop or ignore, as in, 'Belay that last command'". This seemed appropriate for an auth project that will be part of the pirate-themed PressGang suite.
