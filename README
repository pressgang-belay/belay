PressGang Belay

Contains prototype projects around REST web service security.

OpenId directory contains a sample OpenID server implementation.
OAuth2 directory contains an OAuth2 authorisation server implementation, an OAuth2 resource server library and an example REST app using the resource server library. It also contains a GWT OAuth2 client library and sample app.

Development work still in progress.

Why the name? According to one online pirate dictionary (http://www.thepiratesrealm.com/pirate%20talk.html), belay means "either to tie something down tight and secure...or to stop or ignore, as in, 'Belay that last command'". This seemed appropriate for an auth project that will be part of the pirate-themed PressGang suite.
